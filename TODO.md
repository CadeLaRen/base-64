# TODO

- We need a better logo for our system.
- Create an `ISO` image of the system.
- Create a shell installer to setup the system instead of using it as a `live` os.
- Thoroughly test the all the packages before the next release.
- Prettify `version-check.sh` for better readability.
- Improve `install.sh` script.
- Backup the system: pigz uses multicore to improve compression speed.
- Implement [#6](https://github.com/PandaLinux/base-64/issues/6) before the next release.
