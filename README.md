Panda Linux is an `open-source` and `free` operating system. Panda Linux is a [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/source_code) based [Linux distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution).
It is built entirely by compiling source-code, using custom optimizations.

Currently, Panda Linux only supports `x86-64` architecture.
